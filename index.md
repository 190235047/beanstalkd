Beanstalk is a simple, fast workqueue service. Its interface is generic, but
was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume
web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously.

### 23 March 2009

Made release 1.3.

## Run It

First, run `beanstalkd` on one or more machines. There is no configuration
file and only a handful of command-line options.

    $ ./beanstalkd -d -l 10.0.1.5 -p 11300

This starts up `beanstalkd` as a daemon listening on address
10.0.1.5, port 11300.

## Use It

Here's an example in Ruby (see the [client libraries](client.html) to find
your favorite language).

First, have one process put a job into the queue:

    beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
    beanstalk.put('hello')

Then start another process to take jobs out of the queue and run them:

    beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
    loop do
      job = beanstalk.reserve
      puts job.body # prints "hello"
      job.delete
    end

## History

Philotic, Inc. developed beanstalk to improve the response time for the
[Causes on Facebook][cof] application (with over 9.5 million users). Beanstalk
decreased the average response time for the most common pages to a tiny
fraction of the original, significantly improving the user experience.
