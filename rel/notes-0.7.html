<h1>Beanstalkd 0.7 Release Notes</h1>

<p><a href=..>Back to beanstalkd home page</a>.</p>

<pre>
I'm happy to announce beanstalkd 0.7.

This is a small release with one protocol change. This server won't
work with a client designed for any earlier beanstalkd.


WHAT'S NEW
----------

 * Added "-u" option to switch user and drop privileges.
 * Return buried job id during a put command.
 * Build fix on Ubuntu (and probably others).

KNOWN BUGS
----------

 * The min heap data structure is not dynamically-sized. This means a
   fixed hard limit on the number of ready jobs (by default set to
   around 16 million).
