Okay, beanstalkd 1.4 is ready.

To everyone who has contributed to this release and in the past, I can't thank
you enough. This release contains a lot of fixes, a huge new feature, and is
our most portable beanstalkd so far. Thanks for sticking with me!

There will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A client
written for version 1.4 will work unmodified with any later 1.x release of
beanstalkd.
