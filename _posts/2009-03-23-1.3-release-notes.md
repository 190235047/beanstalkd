Here's beanstalkd 1.3.

This is a bugfix release.

There will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A client
written for version 1.3 will work unmodified with any later 1.x release of
beanstalkd.


What's New
----------

 * Fix a crash when processing jobs with a 1-second TTR. (Keith Rarick)
 * Timeout jobs only after TTR expires, not up to one second
   early. (Michael Firsikov)
