This is a mostly bugfix release.

As always, there will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A
client written for version 1.4.5 will work unmodified with any later 1.x
release of beanstalkd.

What's New
----------

 * Fix issue #32, add support for IPv6.
 * Fix issue #38, which caused the binlog to stop being updated in unusual
   situations.
