title: Beanstalkd 1.0 Release Notes
---

Here's beanstalkd 1.0.

There will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0.

I'll make compatible protocol changes on a case-by-case basis. The rule is
this: a client written for version 1.0 will work unmodified with any later 1.x
release of beanstalkd.

This version of the protocol *is* compatible with 0.10 and 0.11.


What's New
----------

 * Fix documentation of max job size.
 * Fix a crash in the kick command.
 * Fix a crash in the put command when out of memory.
 * Some 64-bit debug build fixes.
