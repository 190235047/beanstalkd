title: Beanstalkd 0.10 Release Notes
---

Here's beanstalkd 0.10.

This is a release candidate for beanstalkd 1.0. Please let me know if you find
any bugs, especially in the protocol. I'm not planning any incompatible
protocol changes before beanstalkd 2.0.

This version of the protocol *is* compatible with 0.9, except for the peek
commands.


What's New
----------

 * Fixed bug causing the server to send spurious `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` messages in
   draining mode.
 * Each tube now has its own delay queue.
 * Big performance fix for clients (such as async_observer) that issue
   stats-job frequently on reserved jobs.
 * New command-line option to set the max job size.
 * Various build and portability fixes.
 * Automatically timeout reserve commands if a client has other jobs with
   looming deadlines.
 * More comprehensive stats.
