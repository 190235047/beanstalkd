title: Beanstalkd 0.11 Release Notes
---

Here's beanstalkd 0.11.

This is the second release candidate for beanstalkd 1.0. Please let me know if
you find any bugs, especially in the protocol. I'm not planning any
incompatible protocol changes before beanstalkd 2.0.

This version of the protocol *is* compatible with 0.10.


What's New
----------

 * Update command line help text to document the recent -z option.
 * Fix a memory management bug that caused a crash.
 * Fix a bug that caused the server to hang up if the client sent a command
   line that was too long.
 * Split stats for the peek commands into four counters -- one for each
   command.
 * Unit tests are easier to run.
