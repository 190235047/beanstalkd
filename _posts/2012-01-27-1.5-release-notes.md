title: Beanstalkd 1.5 Release Notes
version: 1.5
size: '61,494'
dist: https://github.com/downloads/kr/beanstalkd/beanstalkd-1.5.tar.gz
---

This is beanstalkd version 1.5. A lot of changes went into this release,
including some big improvements.

*Updated:* please note that the format of log files produced by flag `-b` (the
"binlog") has changed. Beanstalkd 1.5 can read older files, but earlier
versions can't read files produced by beanstalkd 1.5 or later, so use caution
when migrating.

As always, there will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A
client written for version 1.5 will work unmodified with any later 1.x
release of beanstalkd.

Highlights
----------

- removed dependency on libevent
- no more autotools; to build beanstalkd, just type "make"
