title: Beanstalkd 1.4.6 Security Release Notes
version: 1.4.6
size: '140,858'
dist: https://github.com/downloads/kr/beanstalkd/beanstalkd-1.4.6.tar.gz
---

This is a security fix and bugfix release.

As always, there will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A
client written for version 1.4.6 will work unmodified with any later 1.x
release of beanstalkd.

What's New
----------

 * The put command now discards the entire job body before returning
   JOB_TOO_BIG. Previously, it interpreted the job body as commands. This was a
   potential security hole, where malicious users could craft job payload data
   to inject commands without cooperation from the beanstalk client
   application.
 * Fix issue #40 by requiring an absolute path when `-b` is used with `-d`.
