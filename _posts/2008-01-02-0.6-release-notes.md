title: Beanstalkd 0.6 Release Notes
---

I'm happy to announce beanstalkd 0.6.

This release has several protocol changes and other updates. This server won't
work with a client designed for any earlier beanstalkd.


What's New
----------

 * Server returns the newly-inserted job id.
 * The time-to-run (aka timeout) is now given for every job.
 * Build fixes on Mac OS X.
 * Minor speed improvements.
 * The server is more strict about trailing garbage on command lines.
 * Better error reporting -- the server won't just close the connection.


Our Urls
--------

Known Bugs
----------

 * The min heap data structure is not dynamically-sized. This means a
   fixed hard limit on the number of ready jobs (by default set to
   around 16 million).
