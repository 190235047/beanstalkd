title: Beanstalkd 1.4.4 Release Notes
version: 1.4.4
size: '139,120'
dist: http://xph.us/dist/beanstalkd/beanstalkd-1.4.4.tar.gz
---

This is a bugfix release.

As always, there will be no incompatible protocol changes until version 2.0. A
client written for version 1.4.4 will work unmodified with any later 1.x
release of beanstalkd.

What's New
----------

 * Added missing YAML document separator to stats-job output.
 * More reliable unit tests.
 * Fixed a memory leak in the list-tubes-watched command.
 * Allow underscore in tube names.
 * Run network unit tests only if the loopback interface is configured.
 * Clean up temporary files (fiu fifos) from unit tests.
 * Fixed issue #34, which caused beanstalkd to terminate unexpectedly on Snow
  Leopard.
