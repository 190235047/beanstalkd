title: About
---

<p><tt>beanstalkd</tt> is a fast, distributed, in-memory workqueue service. Its
interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the
latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running most
time-consuming tasks asynchronously.</p>

<p>Due to popular demand, the next release, <b>1.4</b>, will offer
persistence.</p>

<p>Philotic, Inc. developed <tt>beanstalkd</tt> to improve the response time
for the <a href=http://apps.facebook.com/causes/>Causes on Facebook</a>
application (with over 9.5 million users). <tt>beanstalkd</tt>
decreased the average response time for the most common pages to a tiny
fraction of the original, significantly improving the user experience.</p>

<h2>How to run it</h2>

<p>First, run <tt>beanstalkd</tt> on one or more machines. There is no
configuration file and only a handful of command-line options.</p>

<pre>$ ./beanstalkd -d -l 10.0.1.5 -p 11300</pre>

<p>This starts up <tt>beanstalkd</tt> as a daemon listening on address
10.0.1.5, port 11300.</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p><!-- You'll probably want to use something like <a
href=http://async-observer.rubyforge.net>Async Observer</a> in Rails to give
super-easy access to the beanstalk queue. If you want to use the beanstalk API
directly, -->Here's an example in Ruby (see the <a href=client.html>client
libraries</a> to find your favorite language).</p>

<p>First, have one process put a job into the queue:</p>

<pre>
beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
beanstalk.put('hello')
</pre>

<p>Then start another process to take jobs out of the queue and run them:</p>

<pre>
beanstalk = Beanstalk::Pool.new(['10.0.1.5:11300'])
loop do
  job = beanstalk.reserve
  puts job.body # prints "hello"
  job.delete
end
</pre>
